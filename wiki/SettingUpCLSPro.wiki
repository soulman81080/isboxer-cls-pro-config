Setting up your Configuration is easier than you may think here within ISboxer...

SPECIAL NOTE: If this is TL;DR material that follows


= Instructions =

1. Create a new using the Quick Setup Wizard

2. Assign each of your Characters on the top left box under "Characters" with every:
	Class category you see under "Key Maps"
	Any "Action Target Group"
This is easily done by selecting the first character up in the top left box, and then dragging the appropriate Key Map(s) to them.

Note: You can assign each character EVERY Class - Level - Spec to them, which will not mess anything up if you do. This will be easier for you if you like to change up specs later on.

3. Then as you're on each character, do note you will be "Required" to select the Virtual Mapped Keys tab in the bottom right of ISBoxer then assign accordingly:
----

== Examples ==

Example of a level 90 Death Knight in Blood Spec:

Virtual Mapped Keys

[Virtual Combat Key Map] is now [87-90 Blood DK Key Map]

Example of a level 90 Monk in Windwalker Spec:

	Virtual Mapped Keys
		
[Virtual Combat Key Map] is now [87-90 Windwalker Monk Key Map]
----

As you see, the above, this will assign each Mapped Key to their appropriate Class Level and Spec group.

If you were just starting out a group of Characters, you would do step one and two, then just update the second part of the Virtual Mapped Keys [1-10 Windwalker Monk Key Map] Once your monk levels to level 11, then you would change this Virtual Mapped Key to the next group: [11-20 Winkwalker Monk Key Map] and so on until max level.
