# Introduction #

**SPECIAL NOTE:** This is TL;DR material that follows... Just warning the ones that are a bit too lazy on reading too much valuable information.

Setting up your Configuration is easier than you may think here within ISboxer...

This configuration is off the famous [HOWTO:Configure ISBoxer like a pro](http://isboxer.com/wiki/HOWTO:Configure_ISBoxer_like_a_pro) which has been expanded around the core concept of having every Ability and Talent within ISBoxer's Game Helpers Macro Set.

In short, you will not have to add a Macro, need to know a macro as each macro you find is already assigned to each Key Map sorted accordingly to each Class Level and Spec.

# Instructions #

1. Create a new Character Set (Team) using the Quick Setup Wizard _(CTRL+Q)_

Example of Quick Setup Wizard:

![https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-gT_hddL-wcc/UGrqseiiPLI/AAAAAAAAABY/hbZudt3qpJI/s707/Quick-Setup-Wizard-Start.png](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-gT_hddL-wcc/UGrqseiiPLI/AAAAAAAAABY/hbZudt3qpJI/s707/Quick-Setup-Wizard-Start.png)

Once you have setup your Team, you will then...

### Assign each Character's Key Maps and [ATG](http://isboxer.com/wiki/Action_Target_Group) ###

2. Assign each of your Characters on the top left box under "Characters" with every:
> Class category you see under "Key Maps"
> and any [Action Target Group](http://isboxer.com/wiki/Action_Target_Group) accordingly.

This is easily done by selecting the first character up in the top left box, and then dragging the appropriate Key Map(s) to them.

Note: You can assign each character **EVERY** Class - Level - Spec to them, which will not mess anything up if you do. This will be easier for you if you like to change up specs later on.

Example of a Blood Death Knight once all Key Maps have been assigned:

### Adding the Virtual Mapped Key to Each Character Step ###

3. Then as you're on each character, do note you will be **"Required"** to select the Virtual Mapped Keys tab in the bottom right of ISBoxer then assign accordingly:

**Example of where the Virtual Mapped Keys Tab is underneath each Character:**

## Examples ##

Example of a level 90 Death Knight in Blood Spec:

[Mapped Keys Tab](Virtual.md) under each the Example Death Knight should be as follows:

In the first box select Virtual Combat and the second box select the appropriate Level Spec Class which should read as:

```
    Virtual Combat Key Map is now 87-90 Blood DK Key Map
```

Example screenshot on the three steps required to complete each section of the Virtual Mapped Keys per character:

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-p0cuDTBw7V4/UGrwtunGbiI/AAAAAAAAABw/-1PuE2C-obc/s875/DK-Virtual-Mapped-Keys.png](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-p0cuDTBw7V4/UGrwtunGbiI/AAAAAAAAABw/-1PuE2C-obc/s875/DK-Virtual-Mapped-Keys.png)

When completed you'll see something like this below

**Example screenshot of Blood Death Knight Virtual Mapped Keys Tab:**

As you see, the above, this will assign each Mapped Key to their appropriate Class Level and Spec group.

If you were just starting out a group of Characters, you would do step one and two, then just update the second part of the Virtual Mapped Keys [1-10 Windwalker Monk Key Map] Once your monk levels to level 11, then you would change this Virtual Mapped Key to the next group: [11-20 Windwalker Monk Key Map] and so on until max level.

Once you have all of your characters Key Maps being assigned, their Virtual Mapped Keys Setup, you can move onto your "Character Sets" (Team) below.

### Removing FTL DPS Keys Step from your Character Sets ###

4. You will **NEED** to _remove_ the FTL DPS Keys Key Map from any new team you create, this is ISBoxer's out of the box default DPS Key Map added once you create a new team.

Removing the FTL DPS Keys under Key Maps is **"Required"** to utilize the powerful Virtual Combat System that ISBoxer offers:

Example of a completed (Team's) Key Maps after removing FTL DPS Keys:

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-HdTlehld3QI/UGrnKOFg0CI/AAAAAAAAABA/mJmocYYyVqs/s720/Character-Sets-Key-Maps-Changed.png](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-HdTlehld3QI/UGrnKOFg0CI/AAAAAAAAABA/mJmocYYyVqs/s720/Character-Sets-Key-Maps-Changed.png)

### Assigning Game Helpers (World of Warcraft) Macro Sets to Each Character ###

5. This is simple enough, by clicking the Game Helpers minus (-) sign and expanding World of Warcraft and assigning each Macro Sets of

  * Deathknight
  * Druid
  * Hunter
  * Mage
  * Monk
  * Paladin
  * Priest
  * Rogue
  * Shaman
  * Warlock
  * Warrior

To their respected Character, so go ahead and select one. I'll select Deathknight Macro Set and assign as follows:

![https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-YTd30SzEwiI/UGr18pulvII/AAAAAAAAACU/_mUM5XIKeBI/s755/Assign-Deathknight-to-DK-Character.png](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-YTd30SzEwiI/UGr18pulvII/AAAAAAAAACU/_mUM5XIKeBI/s755/Assign-Deathknight-to-DK-Character.png)


---


Once you have all of the above done after creating each team, you'll be able to do the following quick and easy step

6. Export to Innerspace... (CTRL+E)

**Special Handicap Note:** If you don't have Innerspace running down by your System Clock, I would recommend firing up Innerspace :)

7. Fire up your team by right clicking on Innerspace and selecting on ISBoxer Character Sets and finding your newly created team!

8. Enjoy your game!

# Special Notes #

Once you have this all configured accordingly, below are notes on certain aspects within this configuration:

  * The IWT (Interact with Target) is configured to the ` key which can be changed to whatever key you normally use. This is required for the Melee ATG (Action Target Group) to work accordingly.

  * The hotkeys to spam are located on our CombatHotkeys Wiki Page, which you can change per your personal preference.

  * All Macros are assigned to each Level Spec Class Key Map as follows:

![https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-m7S0D1rr6kc/UGr6gEyrxVI/AAAAAAAAACk/cLYcwWEMS6g/s912/Macros-Assigned-to-Each-CLS.png](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-m7S0D1rr6kc/UGr6gEyrxVI/AAAAAAAAACk/cLYcwWEMS6g/s912/Macros-Assigned-to-Each-CLS.png)

Which you can remove, replace, or change any order of any macro that's used within here. However out of the box configuration works just as fine, but if you're picky on your rotation, this is up to you to modify. However support for anyone is limited here, so I would suggest using the [ISBoxer Forums](http://isboxer.com/forum/) to get a quicker answer.

I'll **not** support any changes to the configuration if you've done any adding to and etc. If you require support on help with your configuration, please make sure you read [here](http://isboxer.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=13) and make a thread [here](http://isboxer.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=4) accordingly for help with your current configuration that you've modified and feel "stuck."

  * Support is limited on time constraints for myself, I'm only one person, work anywhere from 40-100 hours a week as a freelance developer, and I've provided this configuration "As-is" and will not support any modification

  * I am **NOT** responsible for any of your characters dying, being camped by the opposing faction. Nor am I responsible for if your character decides to commit suicide in-game by jumping off a mountain side or pulls bosses to wipe the whole party/raid.
