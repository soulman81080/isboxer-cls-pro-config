# CLS Configuration File for ISBoxer #

Want to watch how this all works in action? Come check out my stream here, and click the follow so you know when I go live! [Shake Boxing](http://www.twitch.tv/shakeboxing)

You'll be given the opportunity to advance fast within ISBoxer by only creating a new team using the Quick Setup Wizard. Assign the new team it's keymaps, assign the new toons their appropriate keymap, action target group, and hit export to innerspace! Easy as that!

This will ONLY be geared for World of Warcraft, any other game is not supported.

Get started by checking out the [WIKI](http://code.google.com/p/isboxer-cls-pro-config/w/list) before you even think you know what you're doing :)

# Disclaimer and Your Agreement to Use this Configuration #

  * I am **NOT** held responsible for your well being while in game, if you decide to test this out, I do recommend you trying it all out on a training dummy or starting zones within World of Warcraft.

  * I am **NOT** held responsible for another faction camping you due to you not knowing how to run this configuration file.

  * I am **NOT** held responsible if you decide to commit suicide with your Character(s) while in game, whether it's jumping off cliffs, running off cliffs, nor any deaths you will not claim this configuration file was the culprit.

  * Once you modify your configuration file, this file is not covered by support.

e.g. Modifying any of the following and not just limited to:

  * Game Helpers (Macros)
  * Key Maps
  * Variable Keystrokes
  * Window Layouts
  * Repeater Profiles
  * Click Bars
  * Action Target Groups
  * Virtual Files
  * Computers

The only thing covered is the out of the box configuration, other than that, don't worry about making a "Issue" stating that you modified 20 macros and nothing works... Well for one, this is a free configuration and licensed as such.

If you do require support for anything, do consider donations, they do make me want to help even more outside the scope of my free time on expanding this configuration :)
